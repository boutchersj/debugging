let seven = 7;
let three = "3";
console.log(seven + three);
// Add your code below this line
console.log(typeof seven); //returns 'Number'
console.log(typeof three); //returns 'String'

//'typeof' is useful for checking the data type of anything in Javascript
//This can help reduce the risk of type errors
//Javascript recognizes 6 immutable primitive data types: Booleans, Null, Undefined, String, Number, and Symbol (new with ES6)
//Javascript also recognizes 1 mutable data type: Object (includes arrays, which are technically objects)
