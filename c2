// Use console.log() to print the outputTwo variable

//The browser console and freeCodeCamp console act differently
//Using the browser console can cause your console to log more times than you expect it to due to tests and other behind-the-scenes stuff
//Use 'console.clear()' to clear your browser console or to only return your logged message once in the console
